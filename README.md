### Our hypothesis

Local PCA can find the intrinsic low-dimensional parameterization of combustion systems in a data-driven way.

### Our methodology

## Data availability

All datasets used in the current work are provided in the [`data`](data/) directory. The datasets have been generated with the open-source [Spifire](https://spitfire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python library.

## Reproducing paper results using Jupyter notebooks

All code used to produce the results in the original publication and in the supplementary material can be found in the Jupyter notebooks provided in the [`code`](code/) directory. [PCAfold](https://pcafold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library is required.

Below, are the detailed guidelines on reproducing each figure from the original publication:
