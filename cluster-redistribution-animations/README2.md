# Animations of cluster re-distribution inside VQPCA

## Chemical equilibrium (EQ) dataset

#### Initialization with $f$-bins

The animation below shows how cluster definitions change during VQPCA. The observations in clusters get re-distributed in an iterative process from the initial bins of the mixture fraction (*f*) vector.

#### Random initialization

The animation below shows how cluster definitions change during VQPCA. The observations in clusters get re-distributed in an iterative process from the initial randomly generated clusters.

#### Uniform initialization

The animation below shows how cluster definitions change during VQPCA. The observations in clusters get re-distributed in an iterative process from the initial uniformly generated clusters.
